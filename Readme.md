## Overview  

This repository contains a dataset of lumbar vertebrae CT images collected from a retrospective study approved by the Ethics Committee at Tianjin Medical University General Hospital. The dataset includes images from 124 participants (77 females and 47 males) aged 63.1 Â± 16.1 years (range: 24-90 years). The dataset is intended for research and educational purposes in the field of orthopedics.  

## Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria  

### Inclusion Criteria:  
1. Age 18 years and above.  
2. Patients who have undergone lumbar vertebrae CT examinations.  

### Exclusion Criteria:  
1. Patients who have undergone lumbar vertebrae surgery.  
2. Data unrelated to orthopedic diseases.  

## Data Acquisition  

CT images were randomly collected from October 2021 to November 2022 using the following scanners:  
- Philips iCT 256 (Philips, Amsterdam, The Netherlands)  
- GE MEDICAL SYSTEMS Revolution EVO and Optima CT660 (General Electric, Fairfield, CT, USA)  
- SIEMENS SOMATOM Force (SIEMENS, Forchheim, Germany)  

The collected data is divided into four datasets according to the scanner used:  
- iCT  
- Rev  
- Opt  
- SOM
