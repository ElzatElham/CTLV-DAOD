The dataset includes images from 124 participants (77 females and 47 males) aged 63.1 ± 16.1 years (range: 24-90 years). The dataset is intended for research and educational purposes in the field of orthopedics.  



## Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria  

### Inclusion Criteria:  
1. Age 18 years and above.  
2. Patients who have undergone lumbar vertebrae CT examinations.  

### Exclusion Criteria:  
1. Patients who have undergone lumbar vertebrae surgery.  
2. Data unrelated to orthopedic diseases.  

## Data Acquisition  

CT images were randomly collected from October 2021 to November 2022 using the following scanners:  
- Philips iCT 256 (Philips, Amsterdam, The Netherlands)  
- GE MEDICAL SYSTEMS Revolution EVO and Optima CT660 (General Electric, Fairfield, CT, USA)  
- SIEMENS SOMATOM Force (SIEMENS, Forchheim, Germany)  

The collected data is divided into four datasets according to the scanner used:  
- iCT  
- Rev  
- Opt  
- SOM  

## Annotations  

The CT images were manually annotated by an orthopedic doctor with 10 years of clinical experience. For controversial annotations, further consultation was obtained from an orthopedic expert with 30 years of clinical experience to ensure accuracy and reliability.
